## Overview

Skate-Board-LED-Controller is an Arduino project designed to control LED strips on a skateboard using the Seeed Xiao development board. The project utilizes the Arduino IDE and the FastLED library to create stunning lighting effects for the skateboard.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software and hardware components:

- Arduino IDE
- FastLED library
- Seeed Xiao development board
- LED strips compatible with the Seeed Xiao board

## Installation

1. Set up the Seeed Xiao development board with the required drivers.
2. Install the FastLED library in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the LED strips to the Seeed Xiao board following the provided schematics.
4. Upload the Skate-Board-LED-Controller code to the Seeed Xiao board.

## Usage

1. Make sure all hardware components are properly connected and powered.
2. Upload the desired LED lighting patterns to the Seeed Xiao board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Test the lighting effects on the skateboard to ensure proper functionality and visual appeal.
